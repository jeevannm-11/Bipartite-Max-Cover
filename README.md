# Max-Bipartite-Cover

Bipartite Graph: A bipartite graph is an undirected graph in which the n vertices can be partitioned into two sets, 
such that no edges in the graph connects two vertices of same set.

A matching in bipartite graph is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges share
an endpoint. 
A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges).
In a maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. There can be more
than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph.
